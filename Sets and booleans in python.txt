       Set and Booleans

  There are two other object types in Python that we should quickly cover: Sets and Booleans.

Sets:-
Sets are an unordered collection of unique elements. We can construct them by using the set() function. Let's go ahead and make a set to see how it works

x = set()
# We add to sets with the add() method
x.add(1)

#Show
x
{1}

Note the curly brackets. This does not indicate a dictionary! Although you can draw analogies as a set being a dictionary with only keys.

We know that a set has only unique entries. So what happens when we try to add something that is already in a set?

# Add a different element
x.add(2)
#Show
x
{1, 2}

# Try to add the same element
x.add(1)
#Show
x
{1, 2}


Notice how it won't place another 1 there. That's because a set is only concerned with unique elements! We can cast a list with multiple repeat elements to a set to get the unique elements. For example:

# Create a list with repeats
list1 = [1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,1,1]
# Cast as set to get unique values

set(list1)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
